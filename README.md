## Projects
### [Ultimate 11](https://github.com/koushaljk6/Ultimate-11)

* The project objective is to select the best 11 cricket players from the 2022 World Cup data.
* The project methodology is as follows:
  * Data collection: The data was sourced from the ESPN cricket info website, which provides comprehensive statistics and analysis of cricket matches and players.
  * Data cleaning and transformation: The data was processed and formatted according to the project requirements, such as filtering, grouping, aggregating, etc.
  * Data visualization and analysis: The data was visualized and explored using various features of Power BI, such as barchart, treemap, slicer, etc., to create a dashboard that shows the performance of each 
    player in different aspects, such as batting, bowling, fielding, etc.

* The project outcome is a dashboard that displays the best 11 cricket players from the 2022 World Cup data, based on various criteria and metrics, such as runs scored, wickets taken, matches played, strike
  rate, economy rate, etc. The dashboard also allows the user to interact with the data and filter it by different dimensions, such as team, match, player, etc.

### [Youtube-Scrapping](https://github.com/koushaljk6/Youtube-Scrapping)

* This project leverages the YouTube API to gather, structure, and analyze valuable data from multiple YouTube channels, providing insights into channel names, subscriber counts, total views, and video upload counts.
* Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in ensuring data accuracy and organization, setting the stage for more in-depth analysis.
* Visualizations created using the Seaborn library offer a clear comparison of subscriber counts, total views, and video quantities across the selected YouTube channels, making complex data more accessible.
* The special functions, 'get_video_ids()' and 'get_video_details()', help us fetch video IDs and important video info like titles, publish dates, views, likes, and comments. This gives us a deep dive into what's inside these channels.
* The project's data export phase ensures that the collected and analyzed video data can be saved into your local system for further exploration, or sharing purposes.
